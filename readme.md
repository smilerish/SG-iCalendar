I wanted to parse iCalendar for a PHP website, so rather than rolling my own design, I had a look for existing libraries.

*[SG-iCalendar](http://github.com/fangel/SG-iCalendar)* seemed ideal, except it's a great example of PHP5 OOP. I love PHP5 OOP, but the server I'm working on is PHP4 only (and entirely out of my control), so I've forked the library here to hack it to work on PHP4.

To [fangel](http://github.com/fangel): I'm really sorry to do this to your wonderful code. Thanks for your great starting point though!
